# Weather-Application
Fully functional responsive Weather application that displays a 5-day forcast and every 3-Hours forcast based on your Geo location or a given city name. Developed using JavaScript, AJAX with XML and openweathermap api, current data from the openweathermap.org server.

NOTE: Chrome may block some of the scripts, if so, unblock them manually on the top right icon beside the location icon.
